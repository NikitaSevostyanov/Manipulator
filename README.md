Modelling the robot(Manipulator)

-
DESCRIPTION: 
-
In this project i model the Toshiba Manipilator with end-effector, wishing to control its moving to gather smth or do other work via its grabber. It's very useful project for me because I'm interested in manipulators and how to control them, make to move. Characteristics of the manipulator could be changed in urdf/ xacro file by varying parameters.

-
GOALS:
-
-Introduce to ROS, Gazebom, Rviz, urdf, xacro editing
-Improving skills of modelling robots
-Introducing to manipulators
